Hey champions, how are you doing? Hope you’re all doing well 💙

This is our first Angular assignment 🎉
We’ll be building a website similar to this one:
🔗 https://routeegy.github.io/startFramework/#/

As we learned, each page will be created as a component, and we’ll navigate between them using routing.

⏰ Deadline: Next Monday at 2:00 PM.
Best of luck to everyone! 💙💙
